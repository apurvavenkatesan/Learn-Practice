        <h2>Using Child Selector.</h2>
        <p>Child selector can be used when you want to target the direct children of elements.
            Here to display the h2 headings in blue color,I am assuming the parent element has a class named "container".The child selector selects all elements that are direct children of elements with the class "container" and sets their text color to blue.
