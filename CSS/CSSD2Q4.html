    <h1>Facts about Font Family</h1>
    <p> Fonts are more important than one may think.
        The fonts we use in design are carefully chosen for particular types of writing and for what we are writing about. Psychologically, there is a subliminal message when we use a particular font.The font-family property can hold several font names in order to accommodate different browsers which may only accept certain fonts. If the browser does not support the first font, it will try the next font. <br>There are two Types of Font Family Names : <br>
        family-name – The name of a font-family such as: “times,” “courier,” “arial,” etc. <br>
        generic-family – The name of a generic-family such as: “serif,” “sans-serif,” “cursive,” “fantasy,” “monospace.” <br>
        When laying out a font-family into your HTML, start with the fonts you most desire, and end with a generic family. This allows the browser to pick a similar font in the generic family if no other fonts are available.Remember that you must always separate each font value with a comma.</p>
