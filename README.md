Welcome to my Web Development Practice Playground repository! Here, I store my practice codes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I hone my skills and explore new concepts in web development. Whether it's experimenting with layout designs, refining my styling techniques, or delving into JavaScript functionalities, this repository serves as a virtual sandbox where I can freely experiment and learn. As a fresher eager to establish my career in web development, this collection of practice codes reflects my dedication to continuous improvement and my passion for mastering the art of crafting dynamic and engaging web experiences.
